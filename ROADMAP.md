# Dynamic eMode Aave Router — Project Roadmap & Tracker

## What Is This Project?
A smart contract router built on top of Aave V3 that dynamically manages
eMode switching to improve capital efficiency, borrow capacity, and reduce
liquidation risk for users.

---

## What Is the Goal?
1. Build a production-grade protocol (not just a demo project)
2. Write a technical paper with real numbers
3. Publish it on ArXiv and ethresear.ch
4. Enter the protocol engineer circle

## Key Concepts to Know

### ArXiv (arxiv.org)
- Free website run by Cornell University
- Where researchers upload papers before formal peer review
- Think of it like GitHub but for research papers
- Used by real protocol engineers, quant researchers, academics
- No fees, no gatekeeping — just upload a PDF
- Your paper gets a permanent link you can share anywhere

### ethresear.ch
- Ethereum's own research forum
- Read by actual Ethereum core developers and protocol engineers
- Posting here gets you noticed by the right people
- Free to post

### Foundry Fork Testing
- Lets you take a snapshot of real Ethereum mainnet at a past block
- Test your router against real historical Aave pool states
- Replay historical crashes (e.g., LUNA May 2022) locally
- Command: `anvil --fork-url YOUR_ALCHEMY_URL --fork-block-number 19000000`

### Monte Carlo Simulation
- Run the same scenario thousands of times with random inputs
- Tells you: "In X% of market conditions, a user gets liquidated"
- Written in Python, not Solidity
- Gives you the REAL NUMBERS your paper needs

### Risk-Adjusted Capital Efficiency
- Capital Efficiency = how much you can borrow vs what you deposit
- Risk-Adjusted = is that borrowing power worth the liquidation risk?
- Example real number: "Router improved borrow capacity by 31% while
  reducing liquidation probability by 28%"

### Economic Modeling
- Using math and data to predict system behavior under market stress
- Not guessing — calculating
- Example: "If ETH drops 40% in 1 hour, how many users get liquidated?"

## The Real Numbers You Need For Your Paper

| Metric | Symbol | How to Get It |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Capital efficiency improvement | X% | Compare LTV before/after router |
| Borrow capacity increase | Y% | Compare max borrow before/after |
| Gas cost reduction | Z% | Foundry gas snapshots |
| Worst case liquidation delta | Q | Fork tests on historical crash blocks |

These numbers come from your tests and Python simulations.
You cannot write the paper without them.
The paper GROWS alongside the work — not after it.

## Where to Publish (In Order of Effort)

| Platform | Effort | Credibility | Link |
|----------|--------|-------------|------|
| GitHub (PDF in repo) | Very Low | Shows intent | your repo |
| ArXiv | Low | Legitimate academic record | arxiv.org |
| ethresear.ch | Low | Seen by protocol engineers | ethresear.ch |
| Ethereum Magicians | Medium | Community discussion | ethereum-magicians.org |
| IEEE / ACM conferences | Very High | Full academic credentials | - |

**Start with ArXiv + ethresear.ch. That is enough.**

---

## Installing LaTeX on Mac (For Writing Your Paper)
```bash
brew install --cask mactex
```

## Notes & Decisions Log
- Project started as a KDI dummy project
- Goal is to separate this into a standalone published protocol paper
- Python analysis layer will live in `/analysis` folder
- Paper will be written in LaTeX, exported as PDF, versioned in repo
